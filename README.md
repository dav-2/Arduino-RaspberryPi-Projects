# Arduino-ESP32-Projects
This repository contains a collection of Arduino and ESP32 projects focused on embedded systems and hardware programming. I plan to eventually integrate AI techniques into some embedded projects, enhancing them with features such as real-time data processing, object detection, reinforcement learning, and machine learning-powered automation.
