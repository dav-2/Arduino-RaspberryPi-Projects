# Arduino-RaspberryPi-Projects
This repository contains Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects exploring embedded systems and hardware programming. As a Data Scientist and AI Engineer, I plan to eventually integrate AI techniques into some projects, adding features like real-time data processing, object detection, reinforcement learning, and machine learning-powered automation.
